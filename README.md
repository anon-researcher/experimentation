# Topology-aware Continuous Experimentation in Microservice-based Applications - Online Appendix

This is the online appendix for our submission at Middleware'19. It provides the heuristics' source code, a full replication package for both the ranking quality evaluation and the performance evaluation, and additional screenshots of our interactive tooling.

### Table of Contents
1. **[Source Code](#source-code)**<br>
2. **[Screenshots UI](#screenshots-ui)**<br>
3. **[Ranking Quality Evaluation](#ranking-quality)**<br>
4. **[Performance Evaluation](#performance-evaluation)**<br>

### Source Code
The source code of the implemented heuristics can be found as part of the _performance evaluation_ replication package in the folder `performance_evaluation/src`. Detailled instructions to build and execute the heuristics are covered in the [Performance Evaluation Replication Package](#performance-evaluation).
